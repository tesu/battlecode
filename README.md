# to-do list

current stuff to consider in no particular order

1. attackers move towards broadcasting locations
2. attackers broadcast sighted enemies
3. scouts annoy gardeners while staying in tree
4. better heuristics for when to build what
5. tanks to clear out space if there isn't much
6. better dodging
7. moving in a more coordinated fashion
8. get some soldiers to defend nests?
