# to-do list

current stuff to consider in no particular order

1. scouts annoy gardeners while staying in tree
2. better heuristics for when to build what
3. soldiers shoot multiple shots (single fire is too slow)
4. better dodging in general
5. more emphasis on soldiers now
6. not have all units facerush enemies (besides lumberjacks, and especially scouts)
7. better pathing in general (especially for soldiers)
8. actual archon ai for fleeing / moving to open areas for gardeners
